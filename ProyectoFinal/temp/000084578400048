protein interaction mapping c-elegans using proteins involved vulval development protein interaction mapping using large-scale two-hybrid analysis has been proposed way functionally annotate large numbers uncharacterized proteins predicted complete genome sequences approach examined caenorhabditis elegans starting 27 proteins involved vulval development resulting map reveals both known new potential interactions provides functional annotation approximately 100 uncharacterized gene products protein interaction mapping project now feasible c elegans genome-wide scale should contribute understanding molecular mechanisms organism human diseases
