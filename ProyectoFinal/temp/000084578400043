equilibrium regained from nonequilibrium chaos statistical mechanics far-from-equilibrium spatially extended chaotic systems have generally eluded analytical solution leading researchers consider theories based statistical rather than detailed knowledge microscopic length scales building recent discovery separation length scales between macroscopic behavior microscopic chaos simple far-from-equilibrium spatially extended chaotic system has been studied computationally intermediate coarse-grained scales equilibrium properties gibbs distributions detailed balance recovered scales which suggests macroscopic behavior some far-from-equilibrium systems might understood terms equilibrium statistical mechanics
